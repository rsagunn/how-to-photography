      The rule of thirds is a composition guideline that places your subject in the left or right third of an image, leaving the other two thirds more open. While there are other forms of composition, the rule of thirds generally leads to compelling and well-composed shots.

      <li>
        <h3>Align the Subject With Lines or Intersections</h3>
        When youre about to take a photograph, you can enable a 3x3 grid on your digital camera screen and add it as an overlay. Then you focus on the four intersections that the grid lines form and align your subject with one of these—though, you can also align it with the vertical or horizontal lines. The image below is an example, one where the human figure is the subject or the focal point, and appears along the right line, and, this way, the focus remains on the subject—but, rather than detract from it, the other visual elements complement it and set the scene.

        <h3>Align the Linear Elements With Grid Lines</h3>
        You can also align your elements with either the vertical or horizontal axis a nifty effect that can work best in different ways for different subjects and well mention another common program that includes a mobile application is Lightroom. The orientation of your objects and the scene are what will decide which line you can use here. For instance, objects in a landscape such as horizons, trees/forests, beaches, and cityscapes—work best aligned with horizontal grid lines. 
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <h3>Align Objects Diagonally</h3>
        It may sound or look, to be more precise—counterintuitive with all this “x” and “y” axis (or left-right and up-down) linearity going on, to tilt things, but another advanced tactic that youll find can be a big help is if you line elements up diagonally. Its not for everything, to be sure, but its a tactic that does work well whenever you want to capture objects that have got irregular shapes—things like paths, roads, and rivers being good examples, and especially ones that “snake” in wonderful ways. Put the central element on a diagonal and then, to make sure theyre aligned right, check for the diagonal intersection points, as itll help the viewers eyes wander around the image and take it in in a way that is bound to have a more impressive effect on them.
